                <hr>
                <p>We use sensor-based controls and computation to unlock the capabilities of complex mechanisms. Our world-class development teams take projects from initial concept to proof-of-principle prototyping to build-test-build engineering, to field testing and low-rate production.

            <p class="p-left">With eight rotors, MG-1P Series Agriculture Drones employ advanced propulsion and control algorithms to ensure flight safety even if one arm or motor breaks during flight. The motor drive system features a redundant communication mechanism that allows the system to reroute control signals during operation. <br><br>
                A single MG-1P controller can control up to five MG-1P aircrafts simultaneously. This new intelligent remote controller extends the control range to up to 3 km[1] and supports high-resolution video transmission within that range, ensuring flight safety.

            <img class="img-right" src="Assets/IMG/robot.jpg" alt="drone-image">
            <p class="p-right">Spot is a four-legged robot designed for indoor and outdoor operation. It has been the breeding ground for a new approach to dynamic robot control that brings true autonomy within reach.
                <br>
                Spot is electrically powered and hydraulically actuated. It senses its rough-terrain environment using LIDAR and stereo vision in conjunction with a suite of on-board sensors to maintain balance and negotiate rough terrain. It carries a 23 kg payload and operates for 45 minutes on a battery charge.</p>
